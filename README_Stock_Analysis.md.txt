# VBA of Wall Street
Stock Analysis – Challenge 2


## Overview of Project

This project consists of refactoring the original code created for Steve to complete a stock market analysis comparing 2017 and 2018 returns.   

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to analyze the pros and cons of using a refactored code, by comparing run times of the codes when applying them to a larger set of data.  Refactoring the code for Steve is intended to help the VBA script run more efficiently.  


## Results

The original VBA script created for Steve was refactored to a VBA script that includes a stock ticker index variable and three additional arrays. The result was a code that ran more quickly than the original code because it was more efficient.  Overall, the refactored code ran in about 0.51 seconds faster than the original code created for Steve.  Reference the stock performance execution times for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses.

### Summary


## Advantages or Disadvantages of Refactored Code 

There are advantages to refactoring code when completed correctly and without impact to the logic of an original code.  These include increased performance and efficiency in run time by reducing some of the complexity or length of script in the logic.  The disadvantage to refactoring a code however can be the introduction of new errors that can disrupt the effectiveness of the code overall. 


## Application of Refactoring Code for Stock Analysis

The application of refactoring code in this example applied some of the advantages and disadvantages as described.  The clear advantage in this example was a VBA script that demonstrated a faster run time than the original VBA script.  However, the length of time spent writing the refactored code left much to be desired by the programmer.  There were numerous errors encountered when defining the stock ticker index.
